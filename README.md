# activity-tools

This project contains building blocks that can be used to create ActivityPub applications.

**Project status**: Experimental, work in progress

## Documentation

Feel free to browse the code, or read the generated [doumentation](https://nsg.github.io/activity-tools/activity_tools.html). If you prefer an example instead I have included a [run.py](https://github.com/nsg/activity-tools/blob/master/run.py) who runs a small sample instance.

## Install

Install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/activity-tools/). Versions after 1.0.0 will follow semantic versioning with a `major.minor.patch` where breaking changes should only occur with a major version bump.

```
pip install activity-tools
```
